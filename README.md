The Harvest Cloud
=================

What is the Harvest Cloud?
--------------------------

The Harvest Cloud is an open source ecommerce and distribution system for local
and regional food networks.  Its aim is to make it easier for both farmers and
eaters to connect and do business.

The application is made up of a collection of [Symfony2][1] bundles:

  * [CoreBundle][2]
  * MarketPlace\BuyerBundle
  * MarketPlace\SellerBundle
  * MarketPlace\HubBundle

Installation
------------

There is no easy way to install the project just yet, but if you're interested,
please contact tom (at) harvestcloud (dot) com.

Volunteers Welcome
------------------

We're always grateful to anyone who wants to lend a hand:

  * Github gurus - we're new to github, so any suggestions/corrections/gentle
criticisms most welcome
  * jQuery magicians - we're down with PHP, but when it comes to jquery,
we seem to have got stuck at the back of the queue
  * pre-pre-alpha testers - it's still not finished, but there's always bits
and pieces to test and critique
  * logo crafters - we're not necessarily looking for a logo, but feel free to
offer your suggestions...

Thanks in advance!
